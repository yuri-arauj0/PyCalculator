# PyCalculator

`calculator_code` is simple `Python 3` which runs directly in your cmd (or whatever it is called in other OS).

I'm currently trying to program a UI (using `PySimpleGUI`) to make it an `.exe` file and run it anywhere on any computer, but I was only able to design the layout.<br>
It still doesn't work like a real calculator, clicking (or typing) the numbers and perfoming the operations.

I'll update this file as I go.<br>
Appreciate every and any help!
